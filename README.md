## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Web Page Creation README! This document will guide you through the process of creating a web page using modern web technologies.

## 2. Technologies Used

The web page creation process will utilize the following technologies:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used for styling and visually enhancing web pages.
- JavaScript: A programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.

## 3. Getting Started

To get started with web page creation, ensure you have a text editor installed on your computer, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. You will also need a web browser to preview and test your web page.

## 4. Folder Structure

To organize your web page project, follow a folder structure like the one below:

```
web-page/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── script.js
```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure and content of your web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file where you define the styles and layout for your web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to your web page (optional).

## 5. Creating the Web Page

Start by creating the basic structure of your web page using HTML in the `index.html` file. Include the necessary HTML tags such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. Add content elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

## 6. Customization and Styling

Enhance the appearance of your web page by adding styles using CSS in the `styles.css` file. Use CSS selectors to target HTML elements and apply custom styles, including colors, fonts, margins, padding, and more. Experiment with different styles to achieve the desired look and feel.

## 7. Deployment

To view your web page locally, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Make sure all the file paths are correctly referenced. For example, `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` for linking the CSS file.

For deploying your web page online, consider using web hosting services or platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. These services allow you to publish your web page and make it accessible to others on the internet.
